# Security Risks of .lnk Files

## Overview
`.lnk` files are Windows shortcut files that point to executable programs or scripts. While they are useful for quick access, they can be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code.

## Risks

- **Hidden Payloads**  
  `.lnk` files can contain hidden commands that execute malware when clicked.

- **Social Engineering**  
  Attackers can disguise `.lnk` files as legitimate shortcuts, tricking users into opening them.

- **Execution Without Visibility**  
  Malicious shortcuts can run harmful scripts without displaying a visible window, making detection harder.

- **Automatic Execution**  
  Some vulnerabilities allow `.lnk` files to execute automatically when viewed in Explorer, exploiting security flaws.

## Mitigation

- Do not open `.lnk` files from unknown sources.  
- Keep antivirus and system patches up to date.  
- Enable visibility of file extensions to avoid misleading names.  
- Use endpoint protection to detect abnormal shortcut execution.

Stay vigilant and safeguard your system against `.lnk` file threats!
